A virtual piano keyboard doodling of the C Major Scale done with html, css and javascript for desktop browsers.

## Want to test it out?

## ToDo -list (as a somewhat public shame note to myself)

* I would like to make this responsive in future. Then again the piano does'nt support taps etc. so by the time
* I am writing this it's played only via keyboard (pun intended). So also need more taps!
